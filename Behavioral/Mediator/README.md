# Mediator Pattern

## Description
The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines how a set of objects interact with each other. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Purpose
- Define how a set of objects interact with each other
- Promote loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly
- Centralize complex communications and control logic between related objects

## When to Use
- When a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways
- When reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
- When a behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing

## Structure
- **Mediator**: Interface that defines the contract for communication between components
- **ConcreteMediator**: Implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between components
- **Component**: Base class for all components that contains a reference to a mediator
- **ConcreteComponent**: Specific components that communicate through the mediator

## Real-world Example
Consider an air traffic control system where the control tower mediates communication between aircraft instead of planes communicating directly with each other.
