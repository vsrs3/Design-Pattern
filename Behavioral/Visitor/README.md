# Visitor Pattern

## Description
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It allows you to add new operations without modifying the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Purpose
- Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure
- Let you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates
- Separate algorithm from object structure

## When to Use
- When you need to perform many unrelated operations on objects in an object structure
- When the object structure is stable but operations change frequently
- When you want to avoid polluting classes with operations that don't belong to their core responsibility

## Structure
- **Visitor**: Interface that declares visit operations for each type of concrete element
- **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements each operation declared by Visitor
- **Element**: Interface that declares an accept method that takes a visitor as an argument
- **ConcreteElement**: Implements an accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument

## Real-world Example
Consider a file system where you want to perform different operations (compression, encryption, backup) on different file types without modifying the file classes.
