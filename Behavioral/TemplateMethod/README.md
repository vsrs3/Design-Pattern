# Template Method Pattern

## Description
The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Purpose
- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps
- Ensure that the overall algorithm structure remains unchanged while allowing customization of certain steps
- Promote code reuse by factoring out common behavior

## When to Use
- When you have an algorithm with a fixed structure but want to allow customization of certain steps
- When you want to avoid code duplication by factoring out common behavior into a base class
- When you want to control which parts of an algorithm can be extended by subclasses

## Structure
- **AbstractClass**: Defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps of an algorithm
- **ConcreteClass**: Implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm

## Real-world Example
Consider a data processing application where the overall process is the same (read data, process data, save data) but the specific processing logic varies.
